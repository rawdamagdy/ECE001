                iOS (formerly iPhone OS) is a mobile operating system created and developed by Apple Inc. exclusively
                for its hardware. It is the operating system that powers many of the company's mobile devices, including
                the iPhone and iPod Touch; the term also included the versions running on iPads until the name iPadOS
                was introduced with version 13 in 2019. It is the world's second-most widely installed mobile operating
                system, after Android. It is the basis for three other operating systems made by Apple: iPadOS, tvOS,
                and watchOS. It is proprietary software, although some parts of it are open source under the Apple
                Public Source License and other licenses.[10]
                Unveiled in 2007 for the first-generation iPhone, iOS has since been extended to support other Apple
                devices such as the iPod Touch (September 2007) and the iPad (January 2010). As of March 2018, Apple's
                App Store contains more than 2.1 million iOS applications, 1 million of which are native for iPads.[11]
                These mobile apps have collectively been downloaded more than 130 billion times.
                Major versions of iOS are released annually. The current stable version, iOS 14, was released to the
                public on September 16, 2020.[12] It brought many user interface changes, including the ability to place
                widgets on the home screen, a compact UI for both Siri and phone calls, and the ability to change both
                the default web browser and email apps. No devices were dropped, as all devices supported by iOS 13 are
                able to run iOS 14.<br>

                <h5 class="card-title">Swift</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed
                    by Apple Inc. and the open-source community, first released in 2014. Swift was developed as a
                    replacement for Apple's earlier programming language Objective-C, as Objective-C had been largely
                    unchanged since the early 1980s and lacked modern language features. Swift works with Apple's Cocoa
                    and Cocoa Touch frameworks, and a key aspect of Swift's design was the ability to interoperate with
                    the huge body of existing Objective-C code developed for Apple products over the previous decades.
                    It is built with the open source LLVM compiler framework and has been included in Xcode since
                    version 6, released in 2014. On Apple platforms,[11] it uses the Objective-C runtime library which
                    allows C, Objective-C, C++ and Swift code to run within one program.[12]
                    Apple intended Swift to support many core concepts associated with Objective-C, notably dynamic
                    dispatch, widespread late binding, extensible programming and similar features, but in a "safer"
                    way, making it easier to catch software bugs; Swift has features addressing some common programming
                    errors like null pointer dereferencing and provides syntactic sugar to help avoid the pyramid of
                    doom. Swift supports the concept of protocol extensibility, an extensibility system that can be
                    applied to types, structs and classes, which Apple promotes as a real change in programming
                    paradigms they term "protocol-oriented programming"[13] (similar to traits).[14]
                    Swift was introduced at Apple's 2014 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).[15] It underwent an
                    upgrade to version 1.2 during 2014 and a major upgrade to Swift 2 at WWDC 2015. Initially a
                    proprietary language, version 2.2 was made open-source software under the Apache License 2.0 on
                    December 3, 2015, for Apple's platforms and Linux.[16][17]
                    Through version 3.0 the syntax of Swift went through significant evolution, with the core team
                    making source stability a focus in later versions.[18][19] In the first quarter of 2018 Swift
                    surpassed Objective-C in measured popularity.[20]
                    Swift 4.0, released in 2017, introduced several changes to some built-in classes and structures.
                    Code written with previous versions of Swift can be updated using the migration functionality built
                    into Xcode. Swift 5, released in March 2019, introduced a stable binary interface on Apple
                    platforms, allowing the Swift runtime to be incorporated into Apple operating systems. It is source
                    compatible with Swift 4.[21]
                    Swift 5.1 was officially released in September 2019. Swift 5.1 builds on the previous version of
                    Swift 5 by extending the stable features of the language to compile-time with the introduction of
                    module stability. The introduction of module stability makes it possible to create and share binary
                    frameworks that will work with future releases of Swift.[22]</p>

                <p class="card-text">Objective-C is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that adds
                    Smalltalk-style messaging to the C programming language. It is one of two main programming languages
                    supported by Apple for macOS, iOS, and their respective application programming interfaces (APIs),
                    Cocoa and Cocoa Touch. It was the singular main language until the introduction of Swift in 2014.[3]
                    The language was originally developed in the early 1980s. It was later selected as the main language
                    used by NeXT for its NeXTSTEP operating system, from which macOS and iOS are derived.[4] Portable
                    Objective-C programs that do not use Apple libraries, or those using parts that may be ported or
                    reimplemented for other systems, can also be compiled for any system supported by GNU Compiler
                    Collection (GCC) or Clang.
                    Objective-C source code 'implementation' program files usually have .m filename extensions, while
                    Objective-C 'header/interface' files have .h extensions, the same as C header files. Objective-C++
                    files are denoted with a .mm file extension.</p>
