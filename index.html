			<h3>programming language</h3>
			<div class="container">
				<p>
					A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of strings that produce various kinds
					of machine code output. Programming languages are one kind of computer language, and are used in
					computer programming to implement algorithms.
					Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines
					that use a set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages. Since the early
					1800s, programs have been used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms, music
					boxes and player pianos.[1] The programs for these machines (such as a player piano's scrolls) did
					not produce different behavior in response to different inputs or conditions.
					Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and more are being created every
					year. Many programming languages are written in an imperative form (i.e., as a sequence of
					operations to perform) while other languages use the declarative form (i.e. the desired result is
					specified, not how to achieve it).
					The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form)
					and semantics (meaning). Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C
					programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a
					dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic
					language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.

			<h3>History</h3>
			<div class="container">
				<p>
					Early developments
					Very early computers, such as Colossus, were programmed without the help of a stored program, by
					modifying their circuitry or setting banks of physical controls.
					Slightly later, programs could be written in machine language, where the programmer writes each
					instruction in a numeric form the hardware can execute directly. For example, the instruction to add
					the value in two memory locations might consist of 3 numbers: an "opcode" that selects the "add"
					operation, and two memory locations. The programs, in decimal or binary form, were read in from
					punched cards, paper tape, magnetic tape or toggled in on switches on the front panel of the
					computer. Machine languages were later termed first-generation programming languages (1GL).
					The next step was the development of the so-called second-generation programming languages (2GL) or
					assembly languages, which were still closely tied to the instruction set architecture of the
					specific computer. These served to make the program much more human-readable and relieved the
					programmer of tedious and error-prone address calculations.
					The first high-level programming languages, or third-generation programming languages (3GL), were
					written in the 1950s. An early high-level programming language to be designed for a computer was
					Plankalk√ºl, developed for the German Z3 by Konrad Zuse between 1943 and 1945. However, it was not
					implemented until 1998 and 2000.[25]
					John Mauchly's Short Code, proposed in 1949, was one of the first high-level languages ever
					developed for an electronic computer.[26] Unlike machine code, Short Code statements represented
					mathematical expressions in understandable form. However, the program had to be translated into
					machine code every time it ran, making the process much slower than running the equivalent machine
					code.
					At the University of Manchester, Alick Glennie developed Autocode in the early 1950s. As a
					programming language, it used a compiler to automatically convert the language into machine code.
					The first code and compiler was developed in 1952 for the Mark 1 computer at the University of
					Manchester and is considered to be the first compiled high-level programming language.[27][28]
					The second autocode was developed for the Mark 1 by R. A. Brooker in 1954 and was called the "Mark 1
					Autocode". Brooker also developed an autocode for the Ferranti Mercury in the 1950s in conjunction
					with the University of Manchester. The version for the EDSAC 2 was devised by D. F. Hartley of
					University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory in 1961. Known as EDSAC 2 Autocode, it was a
					straight development from Mercury Autocode adapted for local circumstances and was noted for its
					object code optimisation and source-language diagnostics which were advanced for the time. A
					contemporary but separate thread of development, Atlas Autocode was developed for the University of
					Manchester Atlas 1 machine.
					In 1954, FORTRAN was invented at IBM by John Backus. It was the first widely used high-level general
					purpose programming language to have a functional implementation, as opposed to just a design on
					paper.[29][30] It is still a popular language for high-performance computing[31] and is used for
					programs that benchmark and rank the world's fastest supercomputers.[32]
					Another early programming language was devised by Grace Hopper in the US, called FLOW-MATIC. It was
					developed for the UNIVAC I at Remington Rand during the period from 1955 until 1959. Hopper found
					that business data processing customers were uncomfortable with mathematical notation, and in early
					1955, she and her team wrote a specification for an English programming language and implemented a
					prototype.[33] The FLOW-MATIC compiler became publicly available in early 1958 and was substantially
					complete in 1959.[34] FLOW-MATIC was a major influence in the design of COBOL, since only it and its
					direct descendant AIMACO were in actual use at the time.[35]

			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<div class="container">
				<p>
					A prominent purpose of programming languages is to provide instructions to a computer. As such,
					programming languages differ from most other forms of human expression in that they require a
					greater degree of precision and completeness. When using a natural language to communicate with
					other people, human authors and speakers can be ambiguous and make small errors, and still expect
					their intent to be understood. However, computers do exactly what they are told to do, and cannot
					understand the code the programmer "intended" to write. The combination of the language definition,
					the program, and the program's inputs must fully specify the external behaviour that occurs when the
					program is executed.
					Many languages have been designed from scratch, altered to meet new needs, combined with other
					languages, and eventually fallen into disuse. Although there have been attempts to design one
					"universal" computer language that serves all purposes, all of them have failed to be accepted in
					this role. The need for diverse computer languages arises from the diversity of contexts in which
					languages are used:
					Programs range from tiny scripts written by individual hobbyists to huge systems written by hundreds
					of programmers.
					Programmers range in expertise from novices who need simplicity above all else, to experts who may
					be comfortable with considerable complexity.
					Programs must balance speed, size, and simplicity on systems ranging from microcontrollers to
					supercomputers.
					Programs may be written once and not change for generations, or they may undergo nearly constant
					modification.
					Finally, programmers may simply differ in their tastes: they may be accustomed to discussing
					problems and expressing them in a particular language.
					One common trend in the development of programming languages has been to add more ability to solve
					problems using a higher level of abstraction. The earliest programming languages were tied very
					closely to the underlying hardware of the computer. As new programming languages have developed,
					features have been added that let programmers express ideas that are more removed from simple
					translation into underlying hardware instructions. Because programmers are less tied to the needs of
					the computer, their programs can do more computing with less effort from the programmer. This lets
					them write more programs in the same amount of time.
					Natural language processors have been proposed as a way to eliminate the need for a specialized
					language for programming. However, this goal remains distant and its benefits are open to debate.
					Edsger Dijkstra took the position that the use of a formal language is essential to prevent the
					introduction of meaningless constructs, and dismissed natural language programming as "foolish."
					Alan Perlis was similarly dismissive of the idea.
