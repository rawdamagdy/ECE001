                There is a variety of coding languages developers choose from, and most use the language they are
                most comfortable with. Their preference is formed over time based on their experience using
                different languages.<br>
                HERE ARE THE MOST COMMON LANGUAGES AND HOW THEY ARE USED:

                <p class="card-text">Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules
                    for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. The World Wide
                    Web Consortium's XML 1.0 Specification of 1998 and several other related specifications—all
                    of them free open standards—define XML.
                    The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability across the Internet. It
                    is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages. Although the
                    design of XML focuses on documents, the language is widely used for the representation of arbitrary
                    data structures such as those used in web services.
                    Several schema systems exist to aid in the definition of XML-based languages, while programmers have
                    developed many application programming interfaces (APIs) to aid the processing of XML data.</p>

                <p class="card-text">Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose
                    programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and
                    the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type
                    inference allows its syntax to be more concise. Kotlin mainly targets the JVM, but also compiles to
                    JavaScript (e.g., for frontend web applications using React) or native code (via LLVM); e.g., for
                    native iOS apps sharing business logic with Android apps. Language development costs are borne by
                    JetBrains, while the Kotlin Foundation protects the Kotlin trademark.
                    On 7 May 2019, Google announced that the Kotlin programming language is now its preferred language
                    for Android app developers. Since the release of Android Studio 3.0 in October 2017, Kotlin has
                    been included as an alternative to the standard Java compiler. The Android Kotlin compiler produces
                    Java 8 bytecode by default (which runs in any later JVM), but lets the programmer choose to target
                    Java 8 up to 16, for optimization, or allows for more features, e.g. Java 8 related with Kotlin
                    1.4, and has experimental record class support for Java 16 compatibility.
                    Kotlin support for JavaScript (i.e. classic back-end) is considered stable in Kotlin 1.3 by its
                    developers, while Kotlin/JS (IR-based) in version 1.4, is considered alpha. Kotlin/Native Runtime
                    (for e.g. Apple support) is considered beta.</p>

                <p class="card-text">Java is the official language for programming Android apps, so it’s safe to say
                    that it’s one of the best languages for Android apps. While Java code typically runs on the Java
                    Virtual Machine, on Android, the lines of code are compiled by something called the Dalvik Virtual
                    Machine. There are many Android API’s available for the Java language, and it’s the native coding
                    language used in Android Studio.
                    Java is a tried-and-true platform for both smartphones and computer software. It was developed in
                    1995 by Sun Microsystems (today known as Oracle), so it’s certainly stood the test of time.

                <h5 class="card-title">reactjs</h5>
                <p class="card-text">React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source front-end JavaScript
                    library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a
                    community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the
                    development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with state
                    management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the
                    use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.</p>
