                <p class="card-text">The HyperText Markup Language,(html) is the standard markup language for
                    documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as
                    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
                    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents
                    into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
                    included cues for the appearance of the document.
                    HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects
                    such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create
                    structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists,
                    links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
                    Tags such as img and input directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as
                    surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.
                    Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
                    HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the
                    behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The
                    World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS
                    standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">css</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the
                    presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone
                    technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
                    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and
                    fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in
                    the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
                    specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the
                    structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed
                    between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
                    Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in
                    different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via
                    speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for
                    alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.
                    The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if
                    more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
                    The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type
                    (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a
                    free CSS validation service for CSS documents.
                    In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG,
                    and XUL.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">javascript</h5>
                <p class="card-text">JavaScript , often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to
                    the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and
                    multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and
                    first-class functions.
                    Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. Over
                    97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party
                    libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the
                    user's device.
                    As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative
                    programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates,
                    regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
                    The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or
                    graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs
                    for I/O.
                    JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now core components of
                    other software systems, most notably servers and a variety of applications.
                    Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and
                    respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">php</h5>
                <p class="card-text">PHP is a general-purpose scripting language especially suited to web
                    development.It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994.
                    The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.PHP originally stood for
                    Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext
                    Preprocessor.
                    PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon
                    or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted
                    and executed PHP code – which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data –
                    would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content
                    management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the
                    generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the
                    web context, such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control.PHP code
                    can also be directly executed from the command line.
                    The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP
                    License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every
                    operating system and platform, free of charge.
                    The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the
                    original implementation acting as the de facto standard which other implementations aimed to follow.
                    Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.
                    W3Techs reports that, as of April 2021, "PHP is used by 79.2% of all the websites whose server-side
                    programming language we know."</p>

                <p class="card-text">AngularJS is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web framework mainly
                    maintained by Google and by a community of individuals and corporations to address many of the
                    challenges encountered in developing single-page applications. It aims to simplify both the
                    development and the testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side
                    model–view–controller (MVC) and model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) architectures, along with components
                    commonly used in web applications and progressive web applications.
                    AngularJS is used as the frontend of the MEAN stack, consisting of MongoDB database, Express.js web
                    application server framework, AngularJS itself (or Angular), and Node.js server runtime environment.
                    The AngularJS framework is on Long Term Support ("LTS") until December 31, 2021. After that
                    date Google will no longer update AngularJS to fix security, browser compatibility, or jQuery
                    issues. The Angular team recommends upgrading to Angular (v2+) as the best path forward, but
                    they also provided some other options.

                <p class="card-text">SQL
                    Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for
                    managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a
                    relational data stream management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured
                    data, i.e. data incorporating relations among entities and variables.
                    SQL offers two main advantages over older read–write APIs such as ISAM or VSAM. Firstly, it
                    introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command. Secondly, it eliminates
                    the need to specify how to reach a record, e.g. with or without an index.
                    Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of many types
                    of statements, which may be informally classed as sublanguages, commonly: a data query language
                    (DQL), a data definition language (DDL),a data control language (DCL), and a data
                    manipulation language (DML). The scope of SQL includes data query, data manipulation (insert,
                    update and delete), data definition (schema creation and modification), and data access control.
                    Although SQL is essentially a declarative language (4GL), it also includes procedural elements.
                    SQL was one of the first commercial languages to use Edgar F. Codd’s relational model. The model was
                    described in his influential 1970 paper, "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data
                    Banks". Despite not entirely adhering to the relational model as described by Codd, it became the
                    most widely used database language.
                    SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the
                    International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987 .Since then, the standard has been
                    revised to include a larger set of features. Despite the existence of standards, most SQL code
                    requires at least some changes before being ported to different database systems.</p>
