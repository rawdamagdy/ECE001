                most comfortable with. Their preference is formed over time based on their experience using
                different languages.<br>

                <p class="card-text">Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is
                    designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming
                    language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that
                    compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for
                    recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java
                    virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is
                    similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime
                    provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically
                    not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular
                    programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for client-server web
                    applications, with a reported 9 million developers.
                    Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by
                    Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original
                    and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally
                    released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of
                    the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General
                    Public License. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference
                    implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open source software and used by most developers and
                    is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.
                    As of March 2021, the latest version is Java 16, with Java 11, a currently supported long-term
                    support (LTS) version, released on September 25, 2018. Oracle released the last zero-cost public
                    update for the legacy version Java 8 LTS in January 2019 for commercial use, although it will
                    otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use indefinitely. Other vendors have
                    begun to offer zero-cost builds of OpenJDK 8 and 11 that are still receiving security and other
                    upgrades.
                    Oracle (and others) highly recommend uninstalling outdated versions of Java because of serious risks
                    due to unresolved security issues. Since Java 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, and 15 are no longer supported,
                    Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to the latest version (currently Java 16) or an
                    LTS release.</p>

                <p class="card-text">The .NET Framework (pronounced as "dot net") is a software framework developed by
                    Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows. It includes a large class library called
                    Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language interoperability (each language can use code
                    written in other languages) across several programming languages. Programs written for .NET
                    Framework execute in a software environment (in contrast to a hardware environment) named the Common
                    Language Runtime (CLR). The CLR is an application virtual machine that provides services such as
                    security, memory management, and exception handling. As such, computer code written using .NET
                    Framework is called "managed code". FCL and CLR together constitute the .NET Framework.
                    FCL provides the user interface, data access, database connectivity, cryptography, web application
                    development, numeric algorithms, and network communications. Programmers produce software by
                    combining their source code with .NET Framework and other libraries. The framework is intended to be
                    used by most new applications created for the Windows platform. Microsoft also produces an
                    integrated development environment for .NET software called Visual Studio.
                    .NET Framework began as proprietary software, although the firm worked to standardize the software
                    stack almost immediately, even before its first release. Despite the standardization efforts,
                    developers, mainly those in the free and open-source software communities, expressed their unease
                    with the selected terms and the prospects of any free and open-source implementation, especially
                    regarding software patents. Since then, Microsoft has changed .NET development to more closely
                    follow a contemporary model of a community-developed software project, including issuing an update
                    to its patent promising to address the concerns.
                    In April 2019, Microsoft released .NET Framework 4.8, the last version of the framework as a
                    proprietary offering. Only monthly security and reliability bug fixes to that version have been
                    released since then. No further changes to that version are planned.</p>

                <p class="card-text">Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Python's
                    design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. Its
                    language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear,
                    logical code for small and large-scale projects.
                    Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
                    including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. Python
                    is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
                    Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the ABC programming
                    language, and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and
                    introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference
                    counting. Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not
                    completely backward-compatible and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3. Python 2
                    was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.
                    Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">c language</h5>
                <p class="card-text">C (/siÀê/, as in the letter c) is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming
                    language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static
                    type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions.
                    It has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language. Such applications
                    include operating systems and various application software for computer architectures that range
                    from supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems.
                    A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie
                    between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the
                    kernel of the Unix operating system. During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has
                    become one of the most widely used programming languages, with C compilers from various
                    vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. C has
                    been standardized by the ANSI since 1989 (ANSI C) and by the International Organization for
                    Standardization (ISO).
                    C is an imperative procedural language. It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access
                    to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal
                    runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage
                    cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be
                    compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its
                    source code.[citation needed]
                    As of January 2021, C was ranked first in the TIOBE index, a measure of the popularity of
                    programming languages, moving up from the no. 2 spot the previous year.</p>
